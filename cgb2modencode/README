The mapping between protocol/QC pages on CGB and modENCODE project wiki has to be done in the [protocols] section.

* Run

The software can be run from cron but will die if one protocol mapping is missing. In this case, edit the [protocols] section (See above) and run the script again.

* Debugging

If Debug is set to 1, the script will run in verbose mode, logging the call to web pages and using a cache of the CGB site.
